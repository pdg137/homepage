<h2>Preliminary notes</h2>
<ul>

<li>Many many many thanks to my wonderful hosts during this trip: Angela Y and Iain M, Martin and Elizabeth C, <a
href="http://www.strubi.ox.ac.uk/strubi/fuller/">the Stephen Fuller
lab</a>, Daryl A, Bilge
D, Z T, Stephanie Mangenot and the whole
Livolant Lab, and the L family.  This trip was great because of
you!!

<li>To have a working cell phone in Europe make sure you have an
unlocked tri-band GSM phone, then buy a SIM card at any little phone
shop on the street.  I went with Virgin Mobile in England and Orange
in France, but just pick whatever is cheapest when you get there.
Some shops can also unlock phones for you.  And don't forget British &
Euro power adapters!

</ul>

<h2>England</h2>
<p>I had a great time in London, despite not really doing much touristy 
stuff.  Stayed for a couple days in a great youth hostel in Bayswater 
(a mini shopping/eating center north of Hyde park), then with a retired 
couple in Soho (basically the red-light district of London), then for 
the rest of the trip in a less great youth hostel near King's Cross 
(outside the nice part of the city to the North).  The days were short, 
and I tried to spend them walking along the streets looking at things, 
watching people go by, and occasionally meeting new people and talking 
for a long time about random things.  The most striking thing about 
London for me was the array of people that I met here; just sitting in 
a cafe I would hear Spanish, French, Italian, and many languages I 
couldn't identify.  I hung out with a broke guy from Boston who had 
spent a year doing organic farming in Italy, met Vietnamese girls from 
Norway, chatted with Taiwanese tourists in Mandarin, broke up a 
political debate between a German with US accent and a Spanish teacher 
from Spain, played chess and drank a Foster's with an Australian who 
was slowly touring the world, and of course heard a whole variety of 
British accents.  I actually think that the trip improved my English by 
forcing me to think very carefully about the idiomaticity of everything 
I said.  In general, it seems like things are written and spoken in a 
more natural way there: "way out" instead of "exit", "cash machine" 
instead of "ATM", etc...</p>

<p>Walking around the city I was sure I was going to be killed by a car; 
if you haven't been to London you wouldn't believe how hard it is to 
force yourself to look RIGHT first when crossing the street!  They even 
have the direction to look written on the curb to help out tourists, 
but I was unable to break my old habits.  If a car didn't get me, I 
sure a pedestrian would have sooner or later; when approaching someone 
we would both veer to the same side and collide, every single time!</p>

<p>I was happy to get to spend a lot of time with my Angela and Iain in 
London; they were extremely nice hosts, though I know Angela was at 
least partly using me for my willingness to play Settlers - she has 
just about made Iain completely sick of the game by now :)  The high 
point of my time with them was when we took a 10km hike through the 
countryside and came across rhinoceroses, giraffes, and elephants (no 
kidding!!)  I got to visit Bilge in Oxford and have dinner at her 
College (just like the dining scenes in Harry Potter, though not as 
formal), visited Stephen Fuller's structural biology lab there and got 
a tour of Daryl's ultra-fast laser lab, though I screwed up dates and 
sadly missed Profs. Kapanidis and Berry.</p>

<p>Despite what everyone says, eating is great in England.  Just like in 
the US, we almost always went out for some kind of foreign food, but my 
authentic British pub dinner of fish&amp;chips was quite tasty as well.    
Actually, there were only two unpleasant things about London: 
everything costs about twice as much as it does in the US, so I was 
feeling constant pain about the money I spent; and the doorknobs are 
universally terrible.  Seriously - I locked myself in a toilet stall in 
the British Museum, pulled a doorknob off of the door and onto my foot 
in the (otherwise very nice) Soho apartment, and often had to search 
for some tiny bit of metal sticking out of the middle of the door that 
I could pull on to get it open.</p>

<p>That's about all I can think of.  I liked it there a lot!  Not sure if 
I'd want to live there some day, but I'll definitely visit again.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, the touristy stuff is great.  Rosetta stone, Big Ben, London 
Tower, etc - all very pretty.  Even saw the Changing of the Guard, 
which was quite silly.  Didn't spend too much time on them though.  In 
case you are interested, my favorite places to hang out and watch 
people are were duck ponds in St. James Park and the big coffee house 
on the corner of Wardour and Shaftesbury between Soho and Chinatown.</p>

<h2>France</h2>
<p>Clearly differentiating this part of my trip from the first part
was my limited skill in French &mdash; I knew that my communication
with others was going to be a fraction of what it was in London.  I
tried hard when I had a good excuse: my first French success was
recharging a French SIM card for my cell phone, though my pride was
tempered a bit when I realized I had no idea how to work the voicemail
or check my balance.  Not much later, I attempted to order "une
baguette aux pavot" and watched in horror as my tongue produced "un
baguette de pavot", noticeably upsetting the girl at the counter.  It
took several trips to that particular bakery before I learned to
reliably order what I wanted.</p>

<p>Lacking language skills, I mostly resigned to being a quiet
tourist.  I would get onto the streets around 11am, take the metro to
some interesting place, and walk for hours, trying to get a sense for
the city.  As soon as I started doing this, I realized that my feet
were in serious pain from all the walking I had done in London, so I
would get tired very quickly and look for a place to sit down.
Luckily (and of course I expected this!) Paris has little cafes on
every corner; when it started to get dark I would often check into one
and sip a hot chocolate, while trying to figure out what the place is
about.  A typical Paris cafe is very different from, say, a Starbucks
in the US, a place with a healthy feel where people run in to grab a
coffee and donut, maybe read a paper, then run off.  It's much more
like a pub or bar...people will come with their friends and sit for
hours talking, smoking, and drinking anything from espresso to beer or
wine.  The cafes are often so smoky that it's hard for me to stay
inside.  And the drinks, which you pay 4 to 6&euro; for, come in
surprisingly small quantities, somewhere around 50mL.  I bought quite a
few just out of curiosity, to try to figure out how the French can put
up with such ridiculously small drinks, and I can't say I understand
it.
</p>

<p>
Staying at Z's apartment was another thing that made the France
experience totally different from the England one.  I really
appreciated have the place to stay; she has an apartment that looks
small but is really quite spacious for being near central
Paris.  We ate breakfast and cooked dinner at the apartment together
every day, and though it was always delicious, I didn't get as many
chances to meet other interesting people as I did in England.  I think
that it might have been wise to forgo a bit of comfort and force
myself to spend some of my time in Paris at a youth hostel; the
opportunity to meet other travelers could have made the trip much
more interesting.  But there will always be more opportunities to try
that in the future!  One very nice exception was having dinner with
Z's friends G and W, a very interesting couple who
served us "snacks" consisting of a full dinner plus lots of wine,
sherry, and cheese.
</p>

<p>
But what did I actually do in Paris?  Of course, I did a few touristy
things.  First, the Eiffel tower.  Even though I know there are many
buildings (even in Paris) much taller than the tower, it is still a
very impressive sight, because of the way its skeletal design shows
off its massive quantities of steel; especially when you stand in the
huge open space below and look up.  The top was closed that day, but I
took the stairs to the second level and spent a couple of hours on the
observation deck, surrounded by other tourists, gazing at the city
below.  The center of the city is filled by similar-looking, somewhat
old buildings, no more that five or six stories tall, so from the
observation deck (30 stories up?) you get a wonderful bird's-eye-view
of everything.  The second tourist trap that I visited was the Louvre;
though I generally find museums pretty dull, there were a few gems.
Vermeer's <a
href="http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/vermeer/lacemaker.html"><i>The
Lacemaker</i></a> and <a
href="http://essentialvermeer.20m.com/catalogue/astronomer.htm"><i>The
Astronomer</i></a> took me half an hour to find, because they are such
tiny pieces, but they were definitely the most beautiful paintings in
the building; you can get some idea from the links above, but imagine
them being much sharper and with rich, saturated colors.  I was also
pleased to see the ancient Code of Hammurabi, though I had trouble
reading the cuneiform to check whether the laws were any good.  The
<i>Mona Lisa</i> was actually a very pretty painting, but the funniest
(and saddest) thing about it was seeing dozens of people standing
around it, continually taking flash photos of each other.  The only
other remotely touristy thing I did was to sit under the Sacre Cour at
the top of Montmarte, reading a book while watching all of Paris below
me.
</p>

<p>
Having paid better attention to the calendar this time, I went out on
the right day to visit the lab of Francoise Livolant at Uni Paris-Sud
(Orsay), meeting Prof. Livolant, Stephanie Mangenot, Eric Raspaud,
Marta ???, and one younger woman whose name I have unfortunately
forgotten.  They were extremely friendly hosts, treating me to lunch
and coffee then showing me around their labs and talking about their
latest research results on bacteriophage T5, which will prove very
helpful to my own work.  I can see why Rob likes visiting: the steep
hill up to their part of campus should make for a serious biking
challenge every morning.
</p>

<p>
I also took an overnight trip on the TGV to Lyon (amusing fact: <a
href="http://voyages-sncf.com/">voyages-sncf.com</a> doesn't list Etats-Unis
as a country (update after 1.5 years: we are finally on the list!), so
I had to buy the tickets when I was in England) to
visit the Ladous family.  Corinne's Mother, Father, and particularly
her brother were all very amusing and hospitable people, showing me
all around Lyon and keeping me well entertained with stories about
Lyon, Corinne's childhood, life in Guilin, and the Stevie Wonder
website.  It was wonderful to finally meet a family I had heard so
much about!
</p>

<p>
I'll conclude with an image from my last day in Paris - 7&nbsp;AM, in
a small bakery on Rue Didot, nothing is out on the shelves, but Z
asks the woman at the counter something and she calls into the back
room...I see a worker in back open up a huge oven full of breads and
pull out a tray of <em>pain au chocolat</em> just for us.  After
handing over 1.80&euro; for two of them we step back out onto the
street, under the cool, gray sky, and bite into them.  The buttery
bread is so hot and soft that it feels like a hollow shell, and the
sticky chocolate chips almost burn my mouth, as we walk to the Metro
station.  A delicious end to a satisfying trip.
