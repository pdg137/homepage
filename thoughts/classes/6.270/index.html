I helped teach <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~6.270">6.270</a> for three
years, after taking the class as a freshman.  For my first two years,
I was a "TA" - I only worked during the contest itself.  In 2001 I was
an "organizer" - part of the team of students that prepares the
contest.  This last year was the most exciting.  From February to
December, I met with the other ten organizers to discuss everything
from the circuits that would control the robots to the rules of the
contest.
</p>

<p>
Among the organizers, I found that everyone had beliefs I disagreed
strongly with, often so strongly that I couldn't even understand their
point of view.  So I had to work continuously to win allies on certain
issues and evangelize my ideas without polarizing the group or wasting
time.  Making small compromises also helped me convince the group of
things I felt strongly about.
</p>

<p>
My biggest political success was being co-designer of the contest
table itself.  The table was full of compromises: it was the normal
size and shape, kept the (silly!)  requirement that robots orient
themselves at the start of a match, included the simplest possible
active element (something people really wanted), and used the
traditional task of "scoring-object collection" that has always been
the goal of the 6.270 contest.  However, these compromises were just
intended to distract from the main idea; that the contest should be
easy to follow and exciting for the audience, like any professional
sport.  So the scoring rules were simple: the robot with the most
scoring objects won.  These were large, brightly colored, balls,
visible from the back of the audience.  Towards the sides, where the
robots collected their balls, the table sloped downward, so that there
would be fewer borderline cases to judge.  The starting positions were
moved from the sides to the center of the table, to encourage
interaction between robots.  It was a simple, fun table, and I was
really happy to see it used.

The contest worked.  Despite the heaviness of the balls, many robots
rolled them easily around the table, a few could push them onto the
floor, and one robot was capable of launching them, catapult style,
from one side to the other.  Using <a
href="http://www.pololu.com/products/pololu/0001/">the Pololu IR
beacon</a>, the better robots could detect their opponent's location
and used this information to find unobstructed paths across the table.
A few robots were very simple (one just spun in place), while a few
were ridiculously complicated (one came apart into five independent
vehicles).  The robots employed several very different strategies
toward the goal of obtaining balls and made the contest fun to watch.
