The <a href="http://www.wie.uiuc.edu/games/">GAMES camp</a> gave
middle-school girls a chance to build program robots, August 4-10,
2002.

This was a lot of fun, especially because it was the biggest lecture
that I had ever given.  I had about two hours to entertain 20
enthusiastic 12-year-old girls with a class about robot sensors and
actuators.  I think it went well - I started with some structured
background on basic electronics, just like I did for agorobots, but
broke out quickly into demos to illustrate the points.  Early on, I
got the feeling that half of the time half of the girls had no idea
what I was talking about, but that half varied from sentence to
sentence, so that everyone was learning something.  It was very
helpful to go around the room asking questions to keep people awake,
especially because this was a conceptually difficult topic.  The best
part of the day was getting them to speculate on or explain how things
work - since kids like exploring things on their own, I divided them
into two teams and assigned each to figure out what all of the sensors
and actuators were on a robot.  That kept them entertained for about
30 minutes, and I had representatives give mini-reports about their
teams' robots at the end - very helpful!  So in the end I was pretty
satisfied with it, despite my discomfort at the beginning.
