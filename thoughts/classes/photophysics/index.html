<h2>How much light gets to the lens &mdash; effect of aperture</h2>

<ol>
<li>Remind yourself of the thin lens approximation and lens formulas.
<li>Draw a spherical-cow diagram of a simple camera, including the
film, shutter, a thin lens, and an aperture.  Position the lens a
distance <em>L</em> from the film, and give the aperture diameter
<em>d</em>.  Assume <em>L</em>&nbsp;>>&nbsp;<em>d</em>.
<li>Point the
camera at an infinite white screen emitting light with intensity
<em>I</em> and derive the intensity of light at the film, <em>I'</em>.
<li>Define the F-stop <em>f</em> of a lens as d/L and simiplify your
expression.
<li>What image will be recorded on the film in this example?
<li>Write down a sequence of ten F-stop values, starting with 1, that
successively double <em>I'</em>.
<li>On a sunny day (I=600&nbsp;W/m<sup>2</sup>) using a 30mm lens with
a 1/30s exposure, what maximum F-stop can (according to the laws of
physics) create an image on 35mm film that can be blown up to a
300dpi 5x7 print?  (Assume, for example, that you need 100 photons in
every 1/300in pixel to get a good range of brightness.)
