<tr><th>EN (enable) ports</th><td>Must be high to turn on the chip</td></tr>
<tr><th>A ports</th><td>Inputs</th></tr>
<tr><th>Y ports</th><td>Outputs (connect to motors)</th></tr>
<tr><th>Ground</th><td>Connect <em>all ground pins</em> to ground (0V)</td></tr>
<tr><th>VCC1</th><td>Connect to 5V</td></tr>
<tr><th>VCC2</th><td>Connect to 6V for full power</td></tr>

Check with me before plugging this one in, and please put a bit of
masking tape on the chip for saftey; it can explode!

<h2>Using motors</h2>
You will get one <a href="http://www.pololu.com/products/tmg/">Tamiya
twin-motor gearbox kit</a>.  There are two ways to put the kit
together; with a 58:1 (fast) gear ratio or with a 203:1 (slow) gear
ratio.  The slow version will probably be fast enough for us, so use
that one!
<p>
Using our water model from before, think of a motor as a big
waterwheel in the river, that spins when water flows past it.  What
happens when you suddenly try to stop the flow of water?  The wheel
keeps spinning for a while, and pumps water through your circuit.
(This is not just because there is a physical axle spinning here, but
mainly because of the magnetic fields created by the motor coils.)
This extra pumping can cause flash floods (spikes) of 50 or 100 volts
that can do damage to the rest of the circuit.  How do you deal with
these spikes?  The same way Champaign-Urbana dealt with the boneyard
flooding "problem" - build detention basins.  <i>Capacitors</I> are
detention basins for electricity: they can store a lot of extra charge
and release it when needed.  Put these all over your circuit,
especially right on the motor terminals (I will show you how).  The
direction of the big capacitors is important - put them in so that
they will get voltage in the right direction most of the time.

<h2>Putting it all together</h2>

Think of something you want your robot to do (something
<em>simple</em> is best for your first robotics project!) and plan out
a program for it.  It may help you to draw a flowchart on a piece of
paper.  Then, using what you have learned about programming, motors,
and sensors, build it!
