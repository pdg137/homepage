<h1>Agorobots - What to do next</h1>

<h2>The tools you need</h2> Robotics is a very cheap hobby if you know
how to do it right - we just used wire strippers, cutters, and pliers,
all of which you are likely to have at home already.  You'll probably
also want to get a soldering iron, so you can make permanent
connections.  The only expensive tool we used was the <a
href="http://www.microchip.com/1010/pline/tools/picmicro/program/picstart/">PICSTART</a>
PIC programmer, which costs around $200, because it is designed for
professional use.  If you use a slightly more expensive/complicated
microcontroller (the PIC16F84 instead of the PIC16F627), you can get
by with any of a number of inexpensive programmers:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.kmitl.ac.th/~kswichit/f84/f84.htm">F84-Programmer</a>
<li><a href="http://www.covingtoninnovations.com/noppp/">No-parts PIC programmer</a>
</ul>

However, I am not aware of any cheap programmers for the chips that
would work for the chips we used.  The cheapest I could find is the
The <a href="http://www.dontronics.com/newfound.html">Warp-13 PIC
Programmer</a>, for about $100, but I haven't really heard much about
it.

<h2>Buying more parts for your robot</h2>

The motors and wheels came from <a
href="http://www.pololu.com/">Pololu</a>, my robot company.  You can
order more Tamiya parts there, along with some other robot kits and
components.  I got most of the electronics (the PICs, breadboards,
battery packs, etc) from <a href="http://www.jameco.com/">Jameco</a>,
though there are a lot of good electronics catalogs on the web: <a
href="http://www.digikey.com/">Digi-key</a> is the most popular, used
by both hobbyists and large electronics manufacturers.  <a
href="http://www.phanderson.com/">Peter Anderson</a> is a very nice
guy who sells thousands of components to hobbyists without trying to
make a profit - I got the LEDs and a necessary upgrade for my PIC
programmer from him.  <a href="http://www.ti.com/">Texas
Instruments</a> gives out small samples of our <a
href="http://focus.ti.com/docs/prod/productfolder.jhtml?genericPartNumber=SN754410">754410
motor driver chips</a> for free if you fill out a request on their
website.
<p>
Check out small companies like <a
href="http://www.acroname.com/">Acroname</a> and <a
href="http://www.lynxmotion.com/">Lynxmotion</a> for interesting
robot-related kits.  <a href="http://www.allelectronics.com/">All
Electronics</a> has a lot of interesting components, and surplus
companies like <a href="http://www.herbach.com/">Herbach & Rademan</a>
or <a href="http://www.sciplus.com/">American Science & Surplus</a>
are fun to browse.

<h2>Programming the PIC</h2>

The <a
href="http://www.microchip.com/download/lit/pline/picmicro/families/16c62x/40300b.pdf">technical
datasheet</a> on the PICs that we used is the best reference for
learning how the chip works and how to program it.  It's surprisingly
easy to read for a technical manual, and you can get a free printed
copy by sending a request to Microchip.  There are also lots of books
about the PIC - check the reviews on <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> and you will surely be able
to find something helpful.

<h2>Forming a club?</h2>
If you guys want to keep this up, it would be to your advantage to
start an official club at Uni.  It takes time to build robots, and a
regular meeting time (e.g. some day every week after school for an
hour or two) would help keep you on track.  If you set something like
this up, let me know, and I'd be happy to come by once in a while to
give you advice, debug programs, lend you the PIC programmer, or
whatever you need.
<p>
Eventually, the club could invest in some things to make it easier for
you to do robotics; you could buy your own programmer, tools, and
components.  Also, as you know, Uni has been spending a lot of money
on technological improvements recently.  I don't know exactly how it
would work, but if you have a serious club, I bet you could convince
the school to help pay for some of those supplies.  Mr. Smith and
Mr. Carrubba are probably good people to talk to about this.

Thanks for taking my class!  I hope you all had a great time and
learned something.  Robotics and electronics are really tough to get
into if you don't know where to start.  I can tell you (from personal
experience) that a lot of MIT electrical engineering grads have
trouble getting started with robots.  But now that you've had a little
introduction, you are really not too far behind them.  Let me how it
goes!</br> -<a href="http://www.deconfusion.org/paul/">Paul</a>.
