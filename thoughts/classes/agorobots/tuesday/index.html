<h2>What is a robot?</h2>

<p>
You probably already know a robot are when you see it:
</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="center" align="right"><B>Robots:</B></td>
<td><img src="r2d2.jpg">

<a href="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/MPF/rover/sojourner.html"><img src="sojourner.jpg"></a>
</td></tr>

<p>
So what is special about <i>R2D2</i>, <i>Feelin' Crabby</i>, and
<i>Sojourner</i>?

<ul>
<li>Robots are man-made machines.
<li>Robots react to their environment.
<li>Robots actively try to do something.
</ul>

<h2>How do you build a robot?</h2>

People have been trying to build robots for thousands of years, but
progress was very limited before one modern invention: electronics.
Using electronic circuits, it is possible to build tiny machines that
can do extremely complex tasks, from addition and multiplication to
intelligent decision-making.  Electronics can be linked to the
physical world through a variety of sensors and motors to create
machines that interact with their environment in every possible way.
This is why we have to learn a little bit about electronics before we
can start building robots.

<h2>Water as a model for electricity.</h2>

Electricity is like water in a river; it flows downhill:<br>

A <i>battery</i> is a pump that can maintain a difference in water level:<br>
<img src="pump.png"><img src="battery.png"><br>

A <i>resistor</i> is a place where the river is full of rocks.  Water
has a tough time flowing past it, so the level can drop quickly.<br>
<img src="rocks.png"><img src="resistor.png"><br>

A <i>diode</i> is a waterfall; a place where the level of the water
suddenly changes by a certain amount.<br>
<img src="waterfall.png"><img src="diode.png"><br>

<h2>A simple electronic circuit.</h2>
First of all, the battery gives us a voltage difference of 6 volts,
but we want 5, so we'll use a diode (a waterfall, remember) to drop
the level by a little bit (about 1 volt):<br>

Now, we'll let the electricty flow across a resistor and another
diode, then return to the battery:<br>

The second diode is special: as electricity flows over it, it emits
light!  This is called a <i>light-emitting-diode</i> or LED.  Here's
what the circuit looks like as a river:<br>
