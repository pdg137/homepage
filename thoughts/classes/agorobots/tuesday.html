<h2>What is a robot?</h2>

<p>
You probably already know a robot are when you see it:
</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="center" align="right"><B>Robots:</B></td>
<td><img src="r2d2.jpg">
<a href="http://robots6270.mit.edu/contests/2001/robots/58/www/"><img src="crabby.jpg"></a>
<a href="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/MPF/rover/sojourner.html"><img src="sojourner.jpg"></a>
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="center" align="right"><B>Not robots:</B></td>

<h2>How do you build a robot?</h2>

People have been trying to build robots for thousands of years, but
progress was very limited before one modern invention: electronics.
Using electronic circuits, it is possible to build tiny machines that
can do extremely complex tasks, from addition and multiplication to
intelligent decision-making.  Electronics can be linked to the
physical world through a variety of sensors and motors to create
machines that interact with their environment in every possible way.
This is why we have to learn a little bit about electronics before we
can start building robots.
