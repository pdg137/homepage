<h1>Agorobots - Thursday plan</h1>

<h2>Using a switch as input.</h2>
Any pin on the PIC can also be used as an input, so that your robot
can get information about the world around it.  By default, a port B
input (the A ports are harder to use because they don't have a
default) is at 5 volts, and the corresponding bit in memory will be
equal to 1 ("set").  If you connect it to <i>ground</i>, then the bit
in memory will change to a 0 ("clear").  Here's how you can read the
ports in a program:
<pre>
	useinput portb,2	; use B2 as an input
	btfss	portb,2		; skip the next line if B2 is "set" (1)
	goto	it_was_clear	; go to a different place if B2 is "clear" (0)

it_was_set
	; ... anything in here will be run if B2 was "set" ...
	goto done_with_test	; this skips the next section

it_was_clear
	; ... anything in here will be run if B2 was "clear" ...

done_with_test
	; ... the rest of your program goes here ...
</pre>
