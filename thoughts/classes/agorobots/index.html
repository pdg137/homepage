Uni High gave me access to their computer lab for this class, so I set
myself the goal of having them each build and program an extremely
simple autonomous robot.  That's a pretty tall order, since it
requires them to learn a little about electronics, programming, and
control theory in just four days.  Luckily, the five kids who signed
up for this one were extremely excited about it and willing to work
hard on their bots.  Starting early and finishing late every day (I
got my class scheduled at the end of school so we could run over) we
managed to come within about two hours of getting the robots to
actually drive around.  Everyone had already programmed their PIC
microcontrollers in assembly, build a circuits to power it, allow it
to light LEDs, and connect it to switches ("bump sensors").  They were
just starting to wire up the motors and motor drivers when the final
bell rang.  Some were pretty excited about continuing later, but I
failed to convince them to start a regular club, and I never managed
to meet up with them again to help them finish their robots.  Peter
Folk (who sat in on the class) says that I could have saved a lot of
time by skipping some of my friendly introductions at the beginning
and jumping right into programming.  He's probably right - there was
no shortage of enthusiasm in this class!
