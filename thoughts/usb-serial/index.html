title: Linux user Access for a USB-Serial Device
---

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
In the old days, PCs always came with RS-232 serial ports, allowing
them to be connected to various devices such as modems, bar code
readers, PDAs, etc.  I use serial ports for <a
href="/avrlinux/">programming microcontrollers</a>, so I was surprised
to find that my new laptop didn't come with a serial port.  Computers
without serial ports are becoming more and more common, since 90% of
consumers don't need them; luckily for those of use who do need
serial ports, USB to serial adapters are available on the web and in
local stores.  I chose to purchase a <a
href="http://www.keyspan.com/">keyspan</a> high-speed USB-serial
adapter, since the packaging claimed support for linux; but the
instructions here should apply to any working usb-serial device.
</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>
When I plugged in the device, a port <code>/dev/tts/USB0</code> was
automatically created.  Keep in mind that I am using Slackware 10.1
and kernel 2.6.10; your distribution might give you slightly different
results.  Now, here's the problem: that device was created without
user read/write permissions!
</p>

<pre>
  bash-3.00$ ls -l /dev/tts/USB0
  crw-rw----  1 root uucp 188, 0 2005-03-06 17:31 /dev/tts/USB0
</pre>

<p>
It's great that everything worked automatically, but of course, if I
can't access the device from my account, it is pretty much useless to
me.  This is a typical linux problem; the system gets you 99% of the
way there, leaving you with the nearly impossible challenge of
covering that last 1%.
</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p>
Open up the file <code>/etc/group</code> and find the line beginning
with <code>uucp</code>.  You need to add your username to the list of
users at the end of this line, so that it looks like
<pre>
  uucp::14:uucp,paul
</pre>
Log out and log in again; thats it!
