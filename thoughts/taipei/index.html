On my way out to buy breakfast, I step into the street to avoid the
motorcycle repair shop overflowing onto the sidewalk and hop over a
dog sleeping on the warm pavement.  I wait for the animated "walk"
figure at a busy intersection, holding my breath to avoid breathing
air thick with gasoline.  As I cross on the green light, twenty
motorcycles squeeze their way to the front of the stopped traffic.
The riders all wear dust masks.  I reach the vendors' stands and order
my favorite dumplings, <i>xiaol&oacute;ngb&#257;o</i>, a cup of warm <i>d&ograve;u
ji&#257;ng</i>, and a bag of ripe orange <i>j&uuml;zi</i>, all for about a
dollar.  The vendors are amazed at my ability to speak rudimentary
Mandarin, and even practice a bit of English: "Thank you!"  On the way
back, I pass three 7-Elevens in one block.  Around the corner, in a
quiet alley, the air is breathable.  Tropical plants bulge from
balconies above me, hiding rusting window bars.  A large garage ahead
has been converted into a temple; the walls are painted red and
incense burns on a table covered with black wooden figurines.  Two
stray kittens look up at me from beneath the table.  I open a gate
across the street and retreat back into grandmother's house.
