<h1>Further information from Phyllis Ream.</h1>

Phyllis thinks {\bf Christina Rosina Werthwein} married someone important in Chicago.

{\bf Jakob Eberhard Werthwein} (known simply as Eberhard) emigrated to America before marriage.  He
and his family are buried in the cemetery in Hampshire, Illinois; we should photograph the stones.
His son {\bf Charles Werthwein} married {\bf Katherine Becker}, born 1864 in Jacksonville,
Illinois.  They met when he saw an attractive photograph in the window of a photography studio, and
she emerged from the studio.  She lived next door to the Mary Todd family who married Abraham
Lincoln.

Charles and Katherine had four children.  Two died early.  The other two were {\bf Pearl Werthwein}
(never married, had wonderful operatic voice, family sent her to Europe for training at the Sorbonne, but
she had some problem with her vocal cords and an operation ended her singing career; 
% egotistical woman, doted on herself, 
she died in Hampshire) and {\bf Percy C.{}
Werthwein}, born May 14, 1882, in Hampshire, Illinois.  Attended Univ. of Wisconsin until he withdrew so that
the family could afford to send his sister to Europe.  The ``C'' was simply an initial, 
with no associated name.

Percy married {\bf Alice Caroline Bruner} November 4, 1911, in Chester, Iowa.  She was born June
11, 1890, in Elberon, Iowa, to Adam Bruner and Anna Fromm, and she died February 18, 1984, in
National City, California.  They went out to South Dakota and homesteaded there.  Then they
returned to Hampshire.

Katherine died in Hampshire, June 20, 1948, in Hampshire.

Percy died November 18, 1935, in Waterman, Illinois, as a result of an automobile accident near
Leland.  He was on a hunting expedition with friends.

There is a booklet called ``Kane County, 1818-1968, Illinois Sesquicentennial'', with handwritten
marginal notes by Alice, which has a drawing of the Werthwein farm (in Burlington township) on page
34, center left, labelled as the residence of Henry Weightman.  The cupola pictured there on the
barn had to be removed when they moved there in 1915.  They bought the farm from the brothers Henry
and William Ackerman and \$141 per acre.  Phyllis and her siblings were all born in the farmhouse
there.  One of Alice's notes says that ``W. Grandpa'' (Charles), Bill, Alice, and Dolly attended
the Elgin Academy.

The children of Percy and Alice are:
{\bf Carl Burton Werthwein}, born 1912 in Chester, Iowa, died May 3, 1984;
{\bf Dwight Werthwein}, born in Burlington township, Illinois, deceased,
{\bf Roger Percy Werthwein}, born in Burlington township, Illinois, deceased;
{\bf Greta Anne Werthwein}, born in Burlington township, Illinois, married name Parks, living in
Stella, North Carolina;
{\bf Mark Werthwein}, born in Burlington township, Illinois, living in Sycamore, Illinois;
{\bf George Werthwein}, born in Burlington township, Illinois, lives in Oceanside, California;
{\bf Alice Caroline Werthwein}, born in Burlington township, Illinois, lives in Chula Vista, California; and
{\bf Phyllis Pearl Werthwein}, born in Burlington township, Illinois, who married Robert Ream, her
seventh cousin, somehow (the documentation for that relationship is somewhere in Phyllis' house).
