He was known simply as Eberhard, and emigrated to America before
marriage.  He and his family are buried in the cemetery in Hampshire,
Illinois; we should photograph the stones.  His son, <b>Charles
Werthwein</b>, married <b>Katherine Becker</b>, born 1864 in
Jacksonville, Illinois.  They met when he saw an attractive photograph
in the window of a photography studio, and she emerged from the
studio.  She lived next door to the Mary Todd family who married
Abraham Lincoln.

Charles and Katherine had four children.  Two died early.  The other
two were <b>Pearl Werthwein</b> (never married, had wonderful operatic
voice, family sent her to Europe for training at the Sorbonne, but she
had some problem with her vocal cords and an operation ended her
singing career; she died in Hampshire) and <b>Percy C. Werthwein</b>,
born May 14, 1882, in Hampshire, Illinois.  Attended Univ. of
Wisconsin until he withdrew so that the family could afford to send
his sister to Europe.  The "C" was simply an initial, with no
associated name.

Percy married <b>Alice Caroline Bruner</b> November 4, 1911, in
Chester, Iowa.  She was born June 11, 1890, in Elberon, Iowa, to Adam
Bruner and Anna Fromm, and she died February 18, 1984, in National
City, California.  They went out to South Dakota and homesteaded
there.  Then they returned to Hampshire.

Percy died November 18, 1935, in Waterman, Illinois, as a result of an
automobile accident near Leland.  He was on a hunting expedition with
friends.

There is a booklet called "Kane County, 1818-1968, Illinois
Sesquicentennial", with handwritten marginal notes by Alice, which has
a drawing of the Werthwein farm (in Burlington township) on page 34,
center left, labelled as the residence of Henry Weightman.  The cupola
pictured there on the barn had to be removed when they moved there in
1915.  They bought the farm from the brothers Henry and William
Ackerman and $141 per acre.  Phyllis and her siblings were all born
in the farmhouse there.  One of Alice's notes says that "W. Grandpa"
(Charles), Bill, Alice, and Dolly attended the Elgin Academy.
