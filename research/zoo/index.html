<p>This small bacteriophage phage zoo was prepared by Paul Grayson and
Fay Shaw 2005-10-8, as follows:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Various strains of bacteria were grown to an OD<sub>600</sub> of
0.1 (a cell density of approximately 10<sup>8</sup>/ml in LB + 10
mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>.
<li>Phage stock samples were diluted by various factors and
aliquotted: 1xA indicates 1ul of a 10<sup>3</sup> dilution, 100xB
indicates 100 ul of a 10<sup>6</sup> dilution, etc.
<li>Aliquots were mixed with 100ul of bacteria and allowed to sit for
15 min so phages could bind to cells.
<li>1 ml of molten top agar at 45&deg;C was added to the phage/cell
mix and it was plated onto TBAB plates.
<li>Plates were incubated overnight.
</ol>

<p>
Each plaque on a plaque indicates a place where a single phage
landed.  Count the phages, work out the concetrations of phage in the
original samples, and think about why some of the plaques are cloudy
and there are small colonies of bacteria growing on plates that are
completely covered by plaques.
</p>

<h2>Bacteriophage &lambda;</h2>

<p>Phage &lambda; is probably the best studied of all of the
bacteriophages.  Here I am comparing two mutants: &lambda;cI60,
a clear-plaque mutant and &lambda;cI26b221, a clear-plaque mutant that
also has a genome of greatly reduced size.  I am comparing its ability
to grow on <i>E. coli</i> C600, a common strain used for propagating
&lambda; to that on <i>E. coli</i> pop154, a strain that has its
&lambda; receptor protein replaced by a version from
<i>shigella</i>.  I obtained &lambda; and C600 from Mike Feiss, and
the pop154 was from Alex Evilevitch.

<h2>Bacteriophage Hong Kong 97</h2>

<p>
HK97 is almost identical to &lambda;.  We compare its growth on C600
to that on the host, Ymel, that Bob Duda sent me along with the
phages.  Note that there are cloudy regions in the centers of the
plaques - these probably indicate the growth of lysogens.  I'm
not sure what happened to the 10xA plate.

<h2>Bacteriophage N4</h2>

<p>N4 is a phage I obtained from Lucia Rothman-Denes with a very DNA
importation strategy.  Again, I compare its growth on the included
host with that on C600.  Note that N4 plaques are quite small and
fuzzy.  Also, there are resistant colonies that develop at very high
phage concentrations - are these lysogens?

<h2>Bacteriophage &phi;29</h2>

<p>This phage was sent to me by Dwight Anderson and Shelley Grimes.
Structurally, it is the best-understood tailed dsDNA bacteriophage,
and I am showing its growth on its host <i>B. subtilis</i> su+44.  I
also show here a suspected mutant phage that makes really big plaques.
Note that both produce resistant strains at high enough concentrations
and that the mutant plauqes show ring-shaped turbidity.
</p>

<h2>P22</h2>

<p>P22 is a small dsDNA phage that was sent to me by Peter Prvilege.
I am interested in using it for <i>in vivo</i> ejection studies.  I'm
just testing it against its host, a strain of <i>S. typhimurium</i>.
This one displays turbid plaques and reistant colonies.
