<p>
Consider two large compartments containing <b>weak</b> glycerol
solution at concentrations <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>.  The compartments
are joined by a <b>small</b>, asymmetric channel.  Glycerol <b>slowly
diffuses</b> through the channel at a rate <i>F</i>(<i>A</i>,<i>B</i>).
</p>

<p>
Since the solutions are weak, the rate will be linearly proportional
to the concentration difference:
</p>

<p align="center">
<i>F</i>(<i>A</i>,<i>B</i>) = <i>a A</i> - <i>b B</i>
</p>

<p>
for some <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>.
This equation holds for any small values of <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>,
including zero.
</p>

<p>
If <i>A</i>=<i>B</i>, the two compartments are in equilibrium, so
there can be no net flow:
</p>
<p align="center">
<i>F</i>(<i>A</i>,<i>A</i>) = <i>a A</i> - <i>b A</i> = 0;<br>
<i>a = b</i>;<br>
<i>F</i>(<i>A</i>,<i>B</i>) = <i>a</i>(<i>A</i> - <i>B</i>).
</p>

<p>
Suppose <i>A</i> = k, <i>B</i> = 0.  The rate of flow is <i>ak</i>.
If <i>A</i> = 0 and <i>B</i> = k the rate is similarly -<i>ak</i>.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, the channel conducts equally well in both directions.
</p>

<p>
One direction is better than the other only if one of the assumptions
is violated: the concentration is <b>strong</b>, the channel is
<b>large</b> compared to the compartments, or the molecules move
<b>ballistically</b>.  Any model that explains why one direction is
better than another must show which assumption is violated and how the
rates approach equality in a limiting case.
