Hello, my name is Paul Grayson, and this is my personal page on the
web.

I am in charge of IT at and one of the founders of [Pololu Robotics and
Electronics][1], a manufacturer and online retailer in Las Vegas,
Nevada. Earlier, I grew up in [Urbana, Illinois][2] (that's my photo
on Wikipedia!), went to high school at [Uni][3], did college at
[MIT][4], and (apparently imitating Jodie Foster in *Contact*)
received a Ph.D. in physics from [Caltech][5]. Lately much of my time
is occupied with homeschooling my three kids, and I am particularly
interested in the intersection of science, computers, and education.

I do not update this page very often!

You might want to look at my (old) [academic research](research) or
(most even older) [random thoughts](thoughts).

Some sites I maintain:

* [pin1yin1.com](https://pin1yin1.com) &mdash; a Chinese pronunciation converter.
* [a weather station](https://home.tikomaze.com/weewx/) &mdash; the current weather in Henderson, NV, served up by a Raspberry Pi model&nbsp;B+. (Thanks, [FreeDNS](https://freedns.afraid.org/),
for the dynamic DNS!)
* [Simple pages](https://pdg137.github.io/simple-pages/) &mdash; an easy starting point for building a site like this one, using Jekyll on Windows or Linux.
