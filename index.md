Hello, my name is Paul Grayson, and this is my personal page on the
web.

I am in charge of IT and one of the founders at [Pololu Robotics and
Electronics][1], a manufacturer and online retailer in Las Vegas,
Nevada. Earlier, I grew up in [Urbana, Illinois][2] (that's my photo
on Wikipedia!), went to high school at [Uni][3], did college at
[MIT][4], and (apparently imitating Jodie Foster in *Contact*)
received a Ph.D. in physics from [Caltech][5]. Lately much of my time
is occupied with homeschooling my three kids, and I am particularly
interested in the intersection of science, computers, and education.

I do not update this page very often!
